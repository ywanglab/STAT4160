Configure **pre‑commit** to run **Black**, **Ruff** (lint + import sort), and **nbstripout** on every commit.\n","2.  Keep commits clean and **notebook outputs stripped**.\n","3.  Add a fast **GitHub Actions** CI workflow that runs pre‑commit hooks and **pytest** on each PR (Pull Request).\n","4.  Keep CI runtime **under \\~3–4 minutes** with caching and a lean dependency set.\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","## Agenda\n","\n","-    why pre‑commit; the “quality gate”; anatomy of a fast CI\n","-    Black vs Ruff; when nbstripout matters; what belongs in CI\n","-    **In‑class lab**: configure pre‑commit (Black, Ruff, nbstripout) → run locally → add CI workflow → local dry‑run\n","-    Wrap‑up + homework briefing\n","-    Buffer\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","## Main points\n","\n","**Why pre‑commit?**\n","\n","-   Prevent “drive‑by” problems before they enter history: unformatted code, stray notebook outputs, trailing whitespace.\n","-   Hooks run **locally on commit**, then again in **CI** for defense‑in‑depth.\n","\n","**Black & Ruff**\n","\n","-   **Black**: opinionated formatter → consistent diffs; no bikeshedding.\n","-   **Ruff**: very fast linter (flake8 family), plus **import sorting**; can also fix many issues (`--fix`).\n","-   You can use **both** (common) or let Ruff handle formatting too; we’ll use both for clarity.\n","\n","**nbstripout**\n","\n","-   Remove cell outputs from notebooks to keep diffs small, avoid binary (binary code) bloat, and reduce CI time.\n","-   Two patterns: **pre‑commit hook** (recommended) and/or **git filter** (`nbstripout --install`).\n","\n","**CI scope (fast!)**\n","\n","-   Lint + tests only; **no heavy training** in CI.\n","-   Cache dependencies; pin Python (3.11+).\n","-   Keep tests deterministic and **\\< \\~5s** (already done in Session 13).\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","\n","###  **Black**\n","\n","* **What it is:** an **automatic Python code formatter**.\n","* **Goal:** make all Python code look the same — consistent indentation, spacing, quotes, etc.\n","* **Key idea:** “*Blackened code is code you can’t argue about.*”\n","* **Typical usage:**\n","\n","  ```bash\n","  black .\n","  ```\n","\n","  It reformats all `.py` files in place to follow a uniform style.\n","\n","Benefits:\n","\n","* No more style debates (“single vs double quotes”).\n","* Fast and deterministic formatting.\n","* Integrates easily with **pre-commit** and **GitHub Actions**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Ruff**\n","\n","* **What it is:** a **blazing-fast Python linter and formatter**, written in Rust.\n","* **Replaces:** tools like `flake8`, `isort`, and partially `black`.\n","* **Purpose:** catch style errors, unused imports, bad patterns, and optionally auto-fix them.\n","\n","Typical usage:\n","\n","```bash\n","ruff check .\n","ruff format .\n","```\n","\n","Benefits:\n","\n","* Extremely fast.\n","* Enforces PEP8 style, import sorting, and code hygiene.\n","* Can run as part of pre-commit or CI.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **nbstripout**\n","\n","* **What it is:** a **Jupyter Notebook cleaner**.\n","* **Goal:** remove execution outputs (plots, printed text, etc.) before committing `.ipynb` files to Git.\n","* Prevents large diffs and bloated repos.\n","\n","Usage:\n","\n","```bash\n","nbstripout --install\n","```\n","\n","This installs a Git filter so that whenever you commit a notebook, outputs and metadata are automatically stripped.\n","\n"," Benefits:\n","\n","* Keeps notebook diffs clean (only code changes appear).\n","* Saves repo space.\n","* Plays nicely with CI and code

What is `ci.yml`?\n","\n","* It’s a **GitHub Actions workflow file**.\n","* Located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.\n","* It tells GitHub what to do automatically whenever someone **pushes**, **opens a pull request**, or merges into your repo.\n","\n","In the code below, it runs your project’s **tests and pre-commit checks** on GitHub’s cloud runners.\n","\n","\n","```yaml\n","name: CI\n","```\n","\n","* Gives your workflow a **name** (“CI” = Continuous Integration).\n","* This is what appears under the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Trigger

this workflow should run.\n","\n"," **push:** Run when code is pushed to any of those branches (`main`, `master`, `develop`).\n"," **pull_request:** Run when a pull request targets one of those branches.\n","\n","So any new commit or PR to your main development branches automatically triggers the CI checks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Concurrency control\n","\n","```yaml\n","concurrency:\n","  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}\n","  cancel-in-progress: true\n","```\n","\n","This prevents **multiple concurrent runs** of the same workflow on the same branch.\n","\n","* `group:` defines a unique identifier for a run (combines workflow name + branch ref)\n","* `cancel-in-progress: true` cancels any older run if a new one starts on the same branch\n","\n","Example: If you push twice to `main` quickly, the older run is cancelled so only the newest one continues — saves time and compute.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Define jobs\n","\n","```yaml\n","jobs:\n","  build:\n","    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n","    timeout-minutes: 10\n","```\n","\n","* A workflow can have **multiple jobs**; here, only one job named `build`.\n","* `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` → use GitHub’s Linux runner VM.\n","* `timeout-minutes: 10` → automatically cancel if it runs longer than 10 minutes.\n","\n","Each job consists of sequential **steps**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 1 — Checkout your repo\n","\n","```yaml\n","- uses: actions/checkout@v4\n","```\n","\n","* Downloads your repo onto the GitHub runner.\n","* Without this, the workflow wouldn’t see your files.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 2 — Setup Python\n","\n","```yaml\n","- uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n","  with:\n","    python-version: '3.11'\n","    cache: 'pip'\n","    cache-dependency-path: |\n","      requirements.txt\n","      pyproject.toml\n","```\n","\n","* Installs **Python 3.11** on the runner.\n","* Enables **pip cache**, so repeated runs reuse installed packages.\n","* Caches are keyed based on the contents of `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.\n","\n","This makes Python setup faster in subsequent CI runs.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 3 — Install dependencies\n","\n","```yaml\n","- name: Install dependencies\n","  run: |\n","    python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n","    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n","    pip install pre-commit pytest\n","```\n","\n","* Runs a shell command (`run:` block).\n","* Upgrades pip.\n","* Installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if it exists).\n","* Also installs `pre-commit` and `pytest` for code formatting and testing.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 4 — Run pre-commit hooks\n","\n","```yaml\n","- name: pre-commit\n","  uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1\n","```\n","\n","* Runs all hooks defined in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (Black, Ruff, nbstripout, etc.).\n","* Uses the official **pre-commit GitHub Action**.\n","* Ensures consistent formatting and linting before any merge.\n","\n"," This checks your code automatically, just like running:\n","\n","```bash\n","pre-commit run --all-files\n","```\n","\n","locally.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Step 5 — Run pytest\n","\n","```yaml\n","- name: pytest\n","  run: pytest -q --maxfail=1\n","```\n","\n","* Runs your Python unit tests quietly (`-q` = quiet mode).\n","* `--maxfail=1` stops after the first failure (saves time in CI).\n","* If any test fails, the entire workflow fails  — which blocks merging the PR.\n","\n"," That
