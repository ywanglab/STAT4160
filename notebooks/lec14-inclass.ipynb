Configure **pre‑commit** to run **Black**, **Ruff** (lint + import sort), and **nbstripout** on every commit.\n","2.  Keep commits clean and **notebook outputs stripped**.\n","3.  Add a fast **GitHub Actions** CI workflow that runs pre‑commit hooks and **pytest** on each PR (Pull Request).\n","4.  Keep CI runtime **under \\~3–4 minutes** with caching and a lean dependency set.\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","## Agenda\n","\n","-    why pre‑commit; the “quality gate”; anatomy of a fast CI\n","-    Black vs Ruff; when nbstripout matters; what belongs in CI\n","-    **In‑class lab**: configure pre‑commit (Black, Ruff, nbstripout) → run locally → add CI workflow → local dry‑run\n","-    Wrap‑up + homework briefing\n","-    Buffer\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","## Main points\n","\n","**Why pre‑commit?**\n","\n","-   Prevent “drive‑by” problems before they enter history: unformatted code, stray notebook outputs, trailing whitespace.\n","-   Hooks run **locally on commit**, then again in **CI** for defense‑in‑depth.\n","\n","**Black & Ruff**\n","\n","-   **Black**: opinionated formatter → consistent diffs; no bikeshedding.\n","-   **Ruff**: very fast linter (flake8 family), plus **import sorting**; can also fix many issues (`--fix`).\n","-   You can use **both** (common) or let Ruff handle formatting too; we’ll use both for clarity.\n","\n","**nbstripout**\n","\n","-   Remove cell outputs from notebooks to keep diffs small, avoid binary (binary code) bloat, and reduce CI time.\n","-   Two patterns: **pre‑commit hook** (recommended) and/or **git filter** (`nbstripout --install`).\n","\n","**CI scope (fast!)**\n","\n","-   Lint + tests only; **no heavy training** in CI.\n","-   Cache dependencies; pin Python (3.11+).\n","-   Keep tests deterministic and **\\< \\~5s** (already done in Session 13).\n","\n","------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","\n","\n","###  **Black**\n","\n","* **What it is:** an **automatic Python code formatter**.\n","* **Goal:** make all Python code look the same — consistent indentation, spacing, quotes, etc.\n","* **Key idea:** “*Blackened code is code you can’t argue about.*”\n","* **Typical usage:**\n","\n","  ```bash\n","  black .\n","  ```\n","\n","  It reformats all `.py` files in place to follow a uniform style.\n","\n","Benefits:\n","\n","* No more style debates (“single vs double quotes”).\n","* Fast and deterministic formatting.\n","* Integrates easily with **pre-commit** and **GitHub Actions**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **Ruff**\n","\n","* **What it is:** a **blazing-fast Python linter and formatter**, written in Rust.\n","* **Replaces:** tools like `flake8`, `isort`, and partially `black`.\n","* **Purpose:** catch style errors, unused imports, bad patterns, and optionally auto-fix them.\n","\n","Typical usage:\n","\n","```bash\n","ruff check .\n","ruff format .\n","```\n","\n","Benefits:\n","\n","* Extremely fast.\n","* Enforces PEP8 style, import sorting, and code hygiene.\n","* Can run as part of pre-commit or CI.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  **nbstripout**\n","\n","* **What it is:** a **Jupyter Notebook cleaner**.\n","* **Goal:** remove execution outputs (plots, printed text, etc.) before committing `.ipynb` files to Git.\n","* Prevents large diffs and bloated repos.\n","\n","Usage:\n","\n","```bash\n","nbstripout --install\n","```\n","\n","This installs a Git filter so that whenever you commit a notebook, outputs and metadata are automatically stripped.\n","\n"," Benefits:\n","\n","* Keeps notebook diffs clean (only code changes appear).\n","* Saves repo space.\n","* Plays nicely with CI and code
