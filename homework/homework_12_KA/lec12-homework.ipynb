standard.\n","\n","* **What it is:** A single, global clock based on highly accurate atomic time, kept close to Earth-rotation time (UT1). It doesn’t observe **time zones** or **daylight saving**.\n","* **Offset:** UTC is the reference; other zones are offsets from it (e.g., New York is UTC−05:00 in winter, UTC−04:00 in summer).\n","* **Notation:** In ISO-8601 timestamps, a trailing **`Z`** means “Zulu” = UTC (e.g., `2025-10-01T20:15:30Z`).\n","* **Leap seconds:** Occasionally a 1-second adjustment is inserted to keep UTC aligned with Earth’s rotation.\n","\n","### 1.
