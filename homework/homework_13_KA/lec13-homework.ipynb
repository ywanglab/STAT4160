log messages* emitted during a test.\n","It lets you inspect what your code sent to `logging` — e.g., warnings, errors, debug messages.\n","\n","Before the test starts, you set:\n","\n","```python\n","caplog.set_level(logging.WARNING)\n","```\n","\n","→ tells pytest: “Capture all log records at level WARNING or higher.”\n","\n","So, if  `check_for_duplicates(df)` function uses something like:\n","\n","```python\n","logger.warning(\"Found duplicate ticker-date pairs!\")\n","```\n","\n","then that message gets stored in `caplog.records`.\n","\n","\n","\n","| Part                         | Meaning                                                              |\n","| ---------------------------- |

             | the text of each log message (after formatting)                      |\n","| `\"duplicate\" in rec.message` | check whether the substring `\"duplicate\"` appears in the log message |\n","| `any(...)`                   | returns `True` if *at least one* log record contains that substring  |\n","\n","So this line asserts:\n","\n","> “At least one WARNING message was logged that contains the word ‘duplicate’.”\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  Example of what it’s testing\n","\n","If inside `check_for_duplicates` you have:\n","\n","```python\n","logger.warning(\"Found 1 duplicate rows in key columns.\")\n","```\n","\n","then during the test:\n","\n","```python\n","caplog.records[0].message == \"Found 1 duplicate rows in key columns.\"\n","```\n","\n","and the assertion passes because `\"duplicate\"` is in that string.\n","\n","---\n","\n","###  If no message was logged\n","\n","Then `caplog.records` would be empty,\n","`any(\"duplicate\" in rec.message for rec in
